# School Management System API

A robust RESTful API for managing schools, users, and administrative roles, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project is designed to simplify school administration tasks such as managing schools, associating admins, and implementing and user roles with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).



## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Supports multiple user roles including `superadmin` and `schooladmin`.
  - Grants role-specific permissions to manage resources effectively.

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Schools**:
    - Create, Read, Update, and Delete school profiles.
    - Maintain school details and metadata for seamless management.
  - **Users**:
    - Manage user profiles, including creation, updates, and deletions.
    - Associate users with specific schools and roles.

- **Admin Management**:
  - Assign multiple `schooladmin` roles to a single school.
  - Allow `superadmin` users to oversee and manage all school admins.

- **Secure Authentication**:
  - Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - Enforces strict authorization checks for sensitive operations.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Provides clear and consistent error responses for better debugging and user experience.
  - Includes appropriate HTTP status codes:
    - `400 Bad Request`: For validation errors and invalid client inputs.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: For authentication failures.
    - `403 Forbidden`: For insufficient permissions.
    - `404 Not Found`: For resources that do not exist.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: For unhandled exceptions and server issues.
  - Centralized error dispatcher ensures uniform error message formatting.
  - Logs errors for analysis and debugging.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Utilizes **Helmet** to enhance security by setting HTTP headers.
  - Encrypts passwords with **bcrypt.js** for safe storage.
  - Implements input validation to prevent injection attacks.

- **API Rate Limiting**:
  - Protects endpoints from abuse with request rate limiting.
  - Configurable rate limits based on user roles and endpoints.
  - Implemented using `express-rate-limit`

## Installation and Setup(Locally)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
